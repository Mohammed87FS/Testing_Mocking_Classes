# Refactoring Improvements Explained




I broke down the monolithic code into focused methods that each do just one thing:

* Created separate validation methods (`validateOrderId()`, `validateCustomer()`, etc.)
* Pulled out calculation logic into `calculateTotalCost()`  
* Split up the order summary generation into bite-sized pieces

This modular approach means when we need to change something, we only touch a small part of the code - way less chance of breaking things!


The refactored code is much smarter about its dependencies:

* Checks that dependencies actually implement the interfaces we expect
* Verifies the `Customer` object has the required `getCustomerInfo()` method
* Makes sure the `Product` object has both `getProductInfo()` and a `price` property

Now we get helpful error messages when dependencies don't meet our requirements, rather than mysterious runtime failures.



I've made the code tell its own story through:

* Method names that clearly explain what they do
* Detailed JSDoc comments documenting parameters and return values
* Logical grouping of related methods
* Consistent style throughout

Other developers can now understand what's happening without needing to decode the logic.



The validation is now much more thorough:

* Confirms quantities are integers (not just positive numbers)
* Validates dependency interfaces properly
* Provides specific, helpful error messages
* Validates everything upfront to fail fast

This prevents invalid `Order` objects from being created in the first place



Testing is so much easier now because:

* Smaller methods can be tested in isolation
* Helper methods can be easily mocked
* Interface requirements are explicit
* Concerns are properly separated

The result? Better test coverage and tests that are easier to maintain.
